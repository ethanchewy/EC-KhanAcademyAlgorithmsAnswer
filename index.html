          <p>Please try to write the code yourself before looking up the answers! :) 
          It's always rewarding to write it yourself.</p>

          <p>My answers to the course khanacademy course Algorithms (<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms</a>)</p>
          
          <p>I tried to comment on various parts of my code to help explain it more (especially on the parts I had trouble with). </p>
